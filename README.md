Automation of car insurance claim

As a data scientist who works at Allianz Insurance company, the senior data scientist has asked me to create a model that automatically recognizes car brands. This car brand automation will help complete the insurance claim automation process, as it will be added to the already existing damage analysis, making the insurance claim fully automated.

In this Machine Learning project, I will build an image classification pipeline to identify different car brands.

This will help my company automate the insurance claim process, which will boost the efficiency of the company and reduce delays in insurance claims. The expectations from this automation is better customer experience which will lead to an increase in our customer base and a good retention rate of our existing customers.
